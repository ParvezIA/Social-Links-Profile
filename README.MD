## My process

Started the project with scrach and completed the entire project on my own. Took me 3hrs to complete the Challenge. Tried my best to make the code clean and simple.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first challenge for building without the figma file. got stuck for about 1/2hrs just because i was unable to deside the width and height. 

### Continued development

I want to continue developing this project to make this my personal Social links Profile to add in my Porfolio. Open to take suggestions
